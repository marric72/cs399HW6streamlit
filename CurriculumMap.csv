Scenario,,,,
Four college students from diverse racial backgrounds are interested in pursuing a career in international organizations. They are fortunate to land internships in an international company in Hong Kong. They all have high interest in learning Chinese language and culture and cybersecurity and their job is to create materials that help increase cybersecurity awareness among the company's Chinese speaking employees worldwide. Through their collaboration  the interns skillfully crafted materials that not only addressed cybersecurity concerns but also resonated with the diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds of the Chinese-speaking employees. Their efforts went beyond the technical realm  incorporating elements of storytelling  cultural sensitivity  and localized strategies to ensure the materials were not only informative but also engaging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,,,,
